 *  - Sleep:     powerDown() has been called but not yet returned
 *  - PostSleep: powerDown() has returned but no call to fullPowerUp() yet
 *  - No Sleep:  either startPreSleep()/powerDown() has not been called
 *               or it has been canceled with fullPowerUp()
 *
 * Wakeup Reason Detection
 *
 * In mode "Sleep" all relevant changes at the wakeup inputs must be detected.
 * (i.e. no relevant change/edge must be lost)
 *
 * All wakeup reasons are recorded in a wakeup reason bit vector.
 * The wakeup reason vector is an "or" of all HW wakeup reasons which occur while in sleep.
 *
 * The reasons in the vector are cleared when powerDown() is called.
 *
 * The current wakeup reason vector is passed as argument to CheckWakeupDelegate (see below).
