/**
 * Class for writing smaller chunks of bytes to a destination capable of transmitting
 * larger pieces of data.
 *
 * A BufferedWriter will always allocate destination.maxSize() bytes as a buffer and then
 * use this to give away chunks of data when allocating from it. A typical example would be
 * the destination being UDP frames which are used to transport smaller e.g. CAN frames. To
 * minimize the protocol overhead it makes sense to pack multiple CAN frames into an UDP frame.
 *
 * When an allocation cannot guarantee MAX_ELEMENT_SIZE bytes it will commit the current buffer
 * and allocate a new full sized chunk from the destination.
