Overview
--------

The module ``bspSci`` provides an interface for a Serial Communication Interface (SCI) device.
SCI is a standard for data transmission that allows data to be sent and received one bit at a
time (serially) over a communication channel. It is commonly used in embedded systems for
communication between microcontrollers and other peripherals.
