bspFtmPwm - FTM driver
======================

Overview
--------

The FTM module is an enhanced version of the Timer/PWM module (TPM) that provides new features for
motor-control, lighting and power-conversion applications.

The FTM module has a single 16-bit counter that is used by the FTM channels for either the input or
output modes. There are three possible clock sources that can be selected for the FTM counter: the
system clock, the fixed-frequency clock, and the external clock.
