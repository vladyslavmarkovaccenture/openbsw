bspIo - IO driver
=================

Overview
--------

This module is an IO driver that provides access to input/output functionality.
It consists of available port pins, which are represented as part of an enum.
Additionally, it contains enums for specifying whether a pin will be used as an input or output,
available interrupts, and different clock configurations. These enums can be collectively used
for ioConfigurations.
