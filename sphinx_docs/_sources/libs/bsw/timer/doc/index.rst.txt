Overview
--------

The ``timer`` module manages and processes both cyclic and single shot timeouts. It provides
functionality to set these timeouts, check if a timer is active and cancel the enqueued timeouts.
The ``Timer`` class uses the instances of ``Timeout`` class, where each instance represents individual
timeout.
